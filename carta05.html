            <p>
                Thank you for your recent aplication to join us at the University of Awesome's science falculty to study as part de your <abbr title="PhD">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            </p>

            <h2>Starting dates</h2>

            <p>
                We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: </br>

                <ul>
                    </br>
                    <li>Fist semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017 </li>
                    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="sp2">Please let me know if this  is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. </span> </br>
                You can find more information about <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidad" target="_blank">important university dates </a> on our website.
            </p>

            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility &#8212 as long as the subjetcs fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like
                to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:

                <ol>
                    <li>Turning H <sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol &#40C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#41.</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30° C &#40 86°F &#41, when the audience size exponentially increases &#40effect of 3 x 10 <sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10 <sup>4</sup>. &#41 </li>
                    <li> <abbr title=" HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                </ol>

                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

            <p>
                Yes, you are right!. As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answers your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: </br>
                </br>
                Polynesian chicken dance </br>
                <ul class="ul1">

                    <li>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far 300 <abbr title="BC">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be <q>fruitful</q>.</li>
                </ul>

                Icelandic brownian dance
                <ul class="ul2">

                    <li>Before die Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid
                        movement. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem Styles such as twerking.</li>


                </ul>

                Arctic robot dance
                <ul class="ul3">

                    <li>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in lhe 1960s believed lo have discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and
                        Canada. Later on however ii was discovered that they were Just moving Jike this because Lhe y were really cold.</li>
                </ul>
